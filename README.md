# Enigma Machine Wrist Watch

This is the source code used in my Enigma Machine Wrist Watch project.

The original project is described here: [Enigma Machine Watch](https://web.archive.org/web/20170512130929/http://www.asciimation.co.nz/bb/2015/03/24/a-three-rotor-enigma-machine-wrist-watch)

A YouTube film of the machine is available here: [Enigma machine wrist watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm7GEJFp6Bk)

This IS NOT a running project. It requires very custom, one-off hardware and used external libraries not included here. This code is provided purely for interested parties to examine.
